audio_list_instructions
====================

On the next page you'll listen to a list of audio files separated by a brief pause.

====================
demo_boundary_and_prominence
====================

First we will start with a demo. Click Continue to try it out. Add at least one boundary, even if it's at the end of the sentence, and at least one prominence.

====================
demo_boundary_and_prominence_after
====================

Most people put one boundary, at the end of the sentence, and one prominence, on <em>apples.</em> But don't worry about getting it "right." We're after YOUR opinion. Click Continue to get started.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_constrained_instructions
====================

On the next page you'll perform a similar annotation task as before.  This time however, you will listen to the audio exactly twice before moving on.  Also, you will not be able to see the boundary markings you make during the first half of the task.

Experimental Procedure
</p>

You will be annotating excerpts of recorded conversations.  Each page contains the transcript for the excerpt and may also contain the audio recording.  For each excerpt, you will complete two tasks.  First you will break the text into smaller sequences of words.  Second, you will mark certain words.<br /><br />

In the first task, based on some criteria (see next page) you will select a word and a vertical bar will appear after that word:<br /><br />
word word <b>word</b> | word word ...<br /><br /> 

If you change your mind after selecting a word, just select it again and the bar will disappear. In each utterance, you will be able to select as many words that match the necessary criteria. When you have finished, click 'submit'. This will transition you to the next task. <br /><br />

In the <b>second task</b> you will again select words (based on different criteria—see next page), however, this time, once you select a word its color will change to red:<br /><br />
word word <font color="red">word</font> word ...<br /><br />

If you change your mind, just select the word again and it will revert back to black.   During this phase, you will see where you marked the boundaries from the earlier task. When you are finished click <b>submit</b> to move on to the next excerpt.

====================
boundary_and_prominence_agreed_upon_instructions
====================

As instructed previously, for each audio file, you will conduct two tasks. <br /><br />

In normal speech, speakers group words in a way that helps listeners interpret the utterance.<br /><br />

In the <b>first task</b>, select the places where you hear a break, discontinuity or disconnection in the speech stream, strong or subtle. These break the fluid speech stream into different segments. <br /><br />


In normal speech, speakers pronounce some word or words in a sentence with more prominence than others.<br /><br />

In the <b>second task</b>, select the words that stand out in the speech stream by virtue of being louder, longer, more extreme in pitch, or more crisply articulated than other words in the same utterance.  <br /><br />


There are <b>twelve audio excerpts</b>. You will need to play each one at least twice. Please use the second playback to review your work.

====================
first_page
====================

Before each task, you'll be presented with some explanatory text. 
Please read all instructions that appear throughout this experiment carefully.
Do not skip or skim instructions.<br />
First, you will take a demographics survey and fill out a consent form.<br />


====================
post_survey_instructions
====================

The next page features an actual post-experiment survey used in past studies conducted
over LMEDS.

====================

On the next page you'll fill out a demographics page.  <br /><br />

Note that you may skip as many items as you want.

Prospective Agreement Form<br />
Prosodic Event Annotation and Detection in Three Varieties of English<br />
STUDY #FY22-23-3000


====================
consent_form
====================
We are asking you to take part in a research study being done by Jonathan Howell, a faculty member at Montclair State University. Being in this study is optional.<br /><br />

<b>Study's Title:</b>  Prosodic Event Annotation and Detection in Three Varieties of English <br /><br />

<b>Why is this study being done?</b> The purpose of this study is to investigate the acoustics of English speech<br /><br />

<b>What you will be expected to do:</b>  If you agree to participate, you'll perform a variety of tasks with simple instructions that involve listening to audio files and responding to questions.

<b>Your compensation:</b> There is no compensation of any kind for participating in this study. <br /><br />

<b>Risks:</b> The risks are no greater than those in ordinary life. <br /><br />

<b>Benefits:</b> You may benefit from this study by learning about research on language and speech. You can ask after the experiment more details about what we’re trying to find out with our research.<br />
Others may benefit from this study because advancement in understanding the acoustics of speech not only deepens our understanding of the human language capability, it also has implications in a wide range of areas, including language instruction, translation studies, speech therapy, improving comprehensibility of synthesized speech, and improving speech recognition systems.
 <br /><br />

<b>Compensation:</b> To compensate you for the time you spend in this study, you will receive $25.   You are eligible for compensation even if you withdraw.  <br /><br />

<b>Possible risks:</b>  To our knowledge there are no risks or discomforts involved in this research beyond those encountered in other everyday activities. <br /><br />

<b>Who will know that you are in this study?</b> You will not be linked to any presentations. We will keep who you are confidential. Your data will be reported anonymously or in aggregate. <br /><br />

<b>Do you have to be in the study?</b><br /> You do not have to be in this study. You are a volunteer! It is okay if you want to stop at any time and not be included in the study. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to answer. You can leave the study at any time and will still receive the compensation. Your participation or non-participation in the study will have no effect on your standing as an MSU student.<br /><br />

<b>Do you have any questions about this study?</b>  Please contact the author Dr. Jonathan Howell at 240E Conrad Schmitt Hall if you have any questions about this study.  <br /><br />

<b>Do you have any questions about your rights as a research participant?</b> Phone or email the IRB Chair, Dr. Dana Levitt, at 973-655-2097 or reviewboard@montclair.edu<br /><br />

<b>Giving consent to participate:</b> By digitally signing this consent form, you certify that you are 18 years of age or older, that you have read the above and understand it, that you have been given satisfactory answers to any questions about the research, and that you have been advised that you are free to withdraw your consent and to discontinue participation in the research at any time, without prejudice. <br /><br />

Please print a copy of this consent form for your records, if you so desire. <br /><br />

I have read and understand the above consent form, I certify that I am 18 years old or older and, by clicking the submit button to enter the survey, I indicate my willingness to voluntarily take part in the study.<br /><br />
